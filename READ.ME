DynamoDB CRUD Implemented

I implemented CRUD support for the AMW backend using AWS DynamoDB and the AWS SDK v3.
Functions implemented for User, Story, Chapter, and Media tables:

Create

Read by ID

Query by GSI (e.g., stories by user, chapters by story, media by parent)

Delete (media example)

These functions connect to the Amplify-created tables in AWS & match the project schema.
