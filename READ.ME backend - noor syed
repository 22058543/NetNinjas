DynamoDB CRUD Implemented

I implemented CRUD support for the AMW backend using AWS DynamoDB and the AWS SDK v3.
Functions implemented for User, Story, Chapter, and Media tables:

Create

Read by ID

Query by GSI (e.g., stories by user, chapters by story, media by parent)

Delete (media example)

These functions connect to the Amplify-created tables in AWS & match the project schema.


### GraphQL API & Code Generation Setup

- Added GraphQL schema (`schema.json`)
- Added GraphQL operations (`queries.graphql`, `mutations.graphql`)
- Configured GraphQL Code Generator (`backend/codegen.yml`)
- Setup output file (`types.ts`) to receive generated types
- This enables strong typing between the backend and GraphQL API

> Codegen will run in CI or local pipeline once full backend access is available.
